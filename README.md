# RestaurantOrderingSystem
A restaurant ordering system with GUI and database for customers, waiters/waitresses, and kitchen staff.

This program is a complete restaurant ordering system built using the Java Swing GUI, where customers can select a food and beverage for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The order then gets sent to the kitchen staff to start order preparation, and then once the order is complete, it is sent to the waitstaff for billing. The program uses a mySQL database for data persistence, with connectivity via the Java JDBC API and the Java mySQL connector .jar file - both of these are necessary for proper program functionality.
